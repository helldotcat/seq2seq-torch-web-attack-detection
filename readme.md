# Pytorch-based implementation of the "Seq2Seq for Web Attack Detection"

Just ["Seq2Seq for Web Attack Detection"](https://github.com/amurzina/seq2seq-web-attack-detection) reproduced using pytorch 

The Seq2Seq model (2-layers bidirectional LSTM-based encoder and 2-layers LSTM-based decoder) is defined in `rnn_lstm.py`.

The auxiliary training scripts are located in `utils.py`.

The model have been training 2 hours in Google Colab using CUDA.
